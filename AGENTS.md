# tasks-axi — agent notes

Agent-ergonomic task/backlog CLI in the `*-axi` family, built on `axi-sdk-js` and mirroring `gh-axi`.
P1 ships only the markdown backend behind a `Store` seam; sqlite (P2) and remote trackers (P3) are deferred.

## Architecture

The CLI layer never knows which backend is active — it only talks to the `Store` interface.

- `src/cli.ts` — `runAxiCli` wiring: `DESCRIPTION`, `TOP_HELP`, the verb→handler map (with aliases create/view/edit/delete/close), the optional `task` noun prefix, and the global `--backend` / `--file` flags (stripped before handlers, parsed for `resolveContext`).
- `src/context.ts` — `resolveTasksContext` builds the backend `Store` + `ResolvedConfig`; every command receives this `TasksContext`.
- `src/store.ts` - the `Store` interface and `Capabilities`. Core contract: `create/get/update/remove/list/transition/addDep/removeDep/updatePublicFollowup`. `prune`/`render` are optional and capability-gated.
- `src/model.ts` — the `Task` data model (report §5).
- `src/pr-url.ts` — `isPrUrl`, the one canonical PR-URL seam (GitHub `/pull/<n>` on github.com, Forgejo `/pulls/<n>` on any lowercase DNS host) shared by prose link derivation, `--pr` validation, and public-followup `pr_url`; near-misses derive as `doc` links, never `pr`.
- `src/derive.ts` - worker `blocked` / `ready` / active `held` and public delivery readiness are derived in the CLI from `list` + the dep graph + hold date gates, never Store methods, so every backend gets them for free.
- `src/backends/markdown*.ts` — the only P1 backend.
- `src/public-followup.ts` - authoritative versioned schema, strict privacy-safe validation, canonical encoding, immutable-field checks, relation/event readiness, and terminal-state invariants for `kind=public-followup`; `src/commands/public-followup.ts` owns its dedicated CLI state machine.
- `src/commands/*` — one file per verb group; `src/view.ts` owns the read-side TOON projection; `src/confirm.ts` owns the write-side output (the `ok:` confirmation line, the `--json` payload, and `renderMutation`, which assembles both).
- Shared helpers copied from the family: `args.ts`, `body.ts`, `format.ts`, `fields.ts`, `toon.ts`, `suggestions.ts`, `skill.ts`.

## Markdown grammar invariants (the hard part — do not regress)

`src/backends/markdown-grammar.ts` is pure parse/render with no I/O; `markdown.ts` adds the lock + atomic write.

- **Byte-exact round-trip (D1).** `render(parse(src)) === src` on any file nobody has mutated. Each entry keeps its exact original `raw` lines and is emitted verbatim unless `dirty`. A mutated task is re-rendered from its structured fields; untouched entries stay byte-exact. `test/fixtures/backlog.md` exercises every grammar feature; `test/fixtures/firstmate-backlog.md` mirrors firstmate's real `data/backlog.md` shape; a skipped-in-CI test also checks the real firstmate backlog when present.
- **The section header carries the state, not the bullet.** `## In flight`, `## Queued`, `## Done` decide the state. In-flight is recognized as BOTH the legacy `- **id** - …` and firstmate's GitHub-style `- [ ] id - …` checkbox; queued is `- [ ] id - …`; done is `- [x] id - …`. Render is unified on firstmate's real format: in-flight and queued both normalize to `- [ ] id - …` (done to `- [x] id - …`), so a legacy `- **id**` in-flight line normalizes to `- [ ]` when re-rendered and is **never** rewritten the other way — that keeps a tasks-axi-written file readable by firstmate (which assumes `- [ ]`). Byte-exact preservation still holds for untouched lines of either form.
- **Free-form lines (D7)** - any line whose first token is not a clean slug id followed by the delimiter `space-hyphen-space` is preserved verbatim and never operated on by id. The id must be immediately followed by `space-hyphen-space`. This keeps annotated lines like `go-live (CAPTAIN-GATED) - …` and `PR #31 (contributor) - …` free-form (no false positives).
- **Trailing-tag extraction.** Canonical tags (`(repo: X)`, `(kind: X)`, `(priority: 0-4)`, `(since DATE)`, `(merged|reported|done|closed DATE)`, `(hold: REASON)`, `(hold-kind: captain|external|load|parked|future)`, `(hold-until: DATE)`, `blocked-by:/parent:/discovered-from:`) are pulled only off the **trailing** tag-region of a line and re-appended in canonical order on render. This is what makes normalization idempotent: a mid-sentence parenthetical (e.g. `report.md (reported 2026-06-22): …`) or a non-date one (`(closed w/ link)`) is left in the prose and never duplicated or relocated. Date tags require an actual `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Dependency edges carry an optional free-text reason.** firstmate writes `blocked-by: <id> - <reason>` (e.g. `blocked-by: fix-login-k3 - waits on the login refactor`); the id stops at the first space and the reason runs to end-of-line, captured into `Dep.reason` and preserved across a round-trip. A reason does **not** affect `blocked`/`ready` (the graph keys off the blocker id alone), but a blocked item still stays out of `ready`. **Render-order rule:** a bare edge sits right after the title (before the parentheticals), but an edge **with a reason renders last**, after all `( … )` tags — both to match firstmate's real `(repo: …) blocked-by: <id> - <reason>` form and so a re-parse strips the parentheticals first and the reason never swallows a trailing tag (the idempotency trap).
- **Links and leading-word kinds live in the prose**, not as managed tags, so they are never duplicated. `done --pr`/`--report` append the url/path to the title text; links are re-derived by scanning. `kind` comes from a `(kind:)` tag or a leading `SHIP`/`SCOUT`/`DOCS-ONLY`/`PERSISTENT SECONDMATE` word, and the tag is emitted only when the prose does not already lead with that word.
- **body** = the item block under a bullet: every following indented (2-space) OR blank line, up to the next item header or free-form column-0 content (column-0 `## ` section headings are split earlier). Blank separators between paragraphs and trailing blanks before the next item/section belong to the block and move with it (`mv`/`start`/`done`/etc.). Indented pseudo-headings (e.g. `  ## Intent`) are body, never section boundaries. Owned by `parseEntries` in `markdown-grammar.ts`.
  Note writes are inspect-then-update: `show <id> --full`, then `update --body` or `update --body-file` with a curated replacement.
  Add `--archive-body` when the superseded body should be preserved in `note-archive.md`.
- **Public-followup metadata** is one reserved `  <!-- tasks-axi:public-followup/v1:<base64url-canonical-json> -->` line immediately below a `kind=public-followup` bullet.
  The grammar validates it strictly on every read, excludes it from the human body, and re-emits it through render, move, transition, prune, and archive.
  Firstmate and other callers must use `tasks-axi public-followup` and `--json`, never parse or rewrite the comment.
  Generic worker readiness and lifecycle transitions cannot dispatch, complete, reopen, remove, or change the kind of an active obligation; only a posted receipt or Captain waiver completes it.
- **Concurrency:** every mutation runs under `withLock` (advisory `<path>.lock`) and fails closed with a `LOCKED` error if another process holds the lock past the bounded timeout.
  If the lock looks stale, the error tells the user to remove `<path>.lock` only after confirming no `tasks-axi` process is running.
  Corruption-safety is guaranteed independently by atomic temp-file + rename writes, and a hand-edit landing between read and write is detected and refused.
  Reads do not lock.

## Conventions

- **Ids are caller-supplied join keys (D6)** validated by `ID_RE` (slug-shaped); `add --mint [--prefix]` generates a `slug-xx` id.
- **prune archives, never deletes (D4)** - surplus Done tasks are appended to `markdown.archive` or default `done-archive.md`. It keeps N _recognized_ tasks; free-form Done lines are preserved and not counted.
- **`done` auto-prunes** to `config.doneKeep` (default 10) and archives, unless `--no-prune`.
- **`done` on an already-Done task** stays idempotent but backfills supplied `--pr`, `--report`, and non-duplicate `--note` metadata without replacing the original closed date.
- **Dependency mutations validate targets.** `add --blocked-by` and `block --by` reject missing blockers and self-blocks. Parsed dangling blockers are still treated as resolved for legacy hand-edited files.
- **Blocking tasks are protected.** `rm` and single-id `mv` reject a task that still blocks active dependents; unblock or complete the dependents first.
- **`mv` is a multi-id atomic cross-file move.** `mv <id> [<id>...] --to <path>` moves a whole connected set in one transaction (`MarkdownStore.moveManyTo` under a two-file `withLocks`): all land or none do, no intermediate on-disk state that loses a link. Intra-set `blocked-by` edges (reason strings included) survive because both endpoints travel together; `requireNoSplitDeps` refuses and names any edge whose blocker/dependent would be stranded across the two files. Single-id `mv` is just N=1 (`moveTo` delegates to `moveManyTo`), so its byte output is unchanged. Moved items are re-rendered canonically, so trailing blank separators before the next item/section are dropped (a move-then-move-back is byte-exact only when the source had no such trailing blank).
- **Structured holds gate readiness.** `hold <id> --reason "<text>" [--until YYYY-MM-DD] [--kind captain|external|load|parked|future]` writes canonical hold tags; `unhold <id>` clears them.
  Hold reasons are single-line tag values without parentheses because parentheses delimit managed tags.
  Active holds keep queued tasks out of `ready`, while `ready --include-held` emits a separate `held` group.
  `hold-until` is inactive on and after that date.
  `list --state held` filters to active held tasks, and hold columns are available via `--fields held,hold_reason,hold_kind,hold_until`.
- **Hold migration mapping.** Future migration code should map prose markers to structured holds without bulk-rewriting by hand: `HELD` / `do not dispatch` / `CAPTAIN-DECISION` -> `kind: captain` unless the text points elsewhere; `PARKED` -> `kind: parked`; `DEFERRED` -> `kind: future`; load-clearing language such as `hold until <load clears>` -> `kind: load`; external dependency wording -> `kind: external`. Preserve the original prose as the hold reason unless a safer human-readable reason is explicitly supplied.
- Idempotent mutations exit 0 with `already: true`; errors are `AxiError` with SDK exit codes (VALIDATION_ERROR→2, else 1).
- **Write ops are confirmation-forward.** Every mutation (`add`/`start`/`done`/`reopen`/`update`/`rm`/`block`/`unblock`/`hold`/`unhold`/`public-followup`/`mv`/`prune`/`render`) leads with a terse `ok:` line (built in `confirm.ts`) confirming the write result.
  Task-state mutations include the resulting state (e.g. `ok: start <id> -> In flight`), while maintenance/removal commands confirm their own result shape (e.g. `ok: render -> normalized <n>`, `ok: removed <id>`).
  Optional structured detail follows (`add`/`update` keep the full `task:` record), then state-aware hints.
  The `ok:` line is a plain top-level TOON scalar (no `encode()` quoting) - confirmation messages are built from bounded values (ids, names, validated urls/paths, counts) so the combined output still decodes as TOON.
- **Hints are state-aware, never contradictory.** A command must not suggest an action it just performed.
  `add` branches its suggestion on the resulting state (`getSuggestions({action:"add", state})`): `--start`/in-flight → suggest `done`, queued → suggest `start`, done → suggest `reopen`.
  Idempotent paths emit the same state-aware hint as the fresh path.
- **`--json` is the machine-readable success signal.** Every mutation accepts `--json`, which replaces the TOON output with a single pretty-printed object `{ ok: true, action, [already], task|id|operation fields... }` (see `renderMutation` / `taskToJson`).
  This lets an agent confirm a write deterministically without a follow-up read.
  Errors still use structured-error output + non-zero exit (not JSON), so `exit 0` + `ok:true` = success.

## Entry point & the `--version` fast path

`bin/tasks-axi.ts` answers a bare `-v`/`-V`/`--version` through `axi-sdk-js/fast-path` and only then `await import`s `src/cli.js`, so the heavy command graph never loads for a version query (~31ms -> ~20ms, the node floor).
That makes `src/version.ts` a **leaf**: it may import node builtins and nothing else - importing anything from the command graph silently destroys the speedup. `cli.ts` re-imports `VERSION` from it, so there is still one source of the version string.
Any argv shape other than exactly one version flag falls through to `runAxiCli`, which remains the sole owner of the general case (e.g. `list --version` is still an unknown-flag error).
`test/bin/version-fast-path.test.ts` guards this deterministically with an ESM loader module trace (`test/fixtures/module-trace-*.mjs`) plus a negative control; do **not** add a wall-clock timing assertion to CI - it is flaky under runner contention.

## Build / test / ship

- `pnpm build` (tsc), `pnpm test` (vitest, `test/` mirrors `src/`), `pnpm lint` (eslint), `pnpm run build:skill -- --check` (the generated `skills/tasks-axi/SKILL.md` is built from `DESCRIPTION` + `TOP_HELP` and must not drift — CI runs the check).
- `skills/tasks-axi/SKILL.md` is generated — regenerate with `pnpm run build:skill` after changing the description or top-level help; never hand-edit it.
- This repo is no-mistakes-gated; ship through `/no-mistakes`.

### Release & packaging (mirrors the `*-axi` siblings)

- **Published to npm as a public package** via `release-please` → `npm publish --access public --provenance` on a release commit (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`); the captain can also `npm publish` manually. Conventional commits drive the version bump; `release-please-config.json` + `.release-please-manifest.json` own versioning and `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Every `pull_request` workflow (`ci.yml`, `guard-generated-files.yml`, `no-mistakes-required.yml`) uses `paths-ignore` for the release-please output set (`.release-please-manifest.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `package.json`) so release PRs create zero runs. Job-level bot `if`s stay as defense in depth. `test/release-ci-exclusions.test.ts` derives that set from `release-please-config.json` and fails if a workflow drifts; update the ignore lists when adding `extra-files` or changing `release-type`.
- **The tarball ships runtime JS only.** `package.json` `files` is `dist/**/*.js` (+ `skills/tasks-axi`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`), so the `.d.ts`/`.js.map` that `tsc` emits for local debugging are kept out of the package.
  `prepack` runs `npm run build`, so `npm pack`/`npm publish` always rebuild `dist` first.
  In a fresh clone, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` before manual pack or publish.
  Verify with `npm pack --dry-run` (no source/test cruft; bin is `dist/bin/tasks-axi.js` with its shebang preserved by tsc).
- **CI is a 3-OS matrix** (ubuntu/macos/windows) running install → build → lint → test → `build:skill --check`. The `Require no-mistakes` and `Guard generated files` checks gate every PR to `main`.

## Follow-ups (out of P1 scope)

- Migrate firstmate's own `backlog.md` onto tasks-axi (a separate firstmate-repo change).
- sqlite backend (P2); github/jira/linear backends (P3) — slot in behind the existing `Store` seam.
- Optional: count free-form Done lines toward the prune keep, or recognize compound ids (`a / b`).
